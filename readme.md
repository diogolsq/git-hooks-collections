# Git Hooks Collection

This repository contains a collection of git hooks organized by programming language/framework. These hooks help automate various tasks like linting, complexity checks, and evaluating code churn before code is pushed to the repository.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of your git project.
2. Copy the desired hook from this repository into the `.git/hooks/` directory of your project.
3. Make sure the hook script is executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`).
4. **Important**: Update your project's `.gitignore` file to ignore the temporary diff files generated by the hooks:
    ```
    # Ignore temporary diff files generated by pre-push hooks
    pre_push_diff_*.txt
    ```

## Available Hooks

### JavaScript

- **Linting**: Uses ESLint to lint changed JS files.
- **Complexity**: Uses [your-tool] to check complexity.

### Ruby

- **Linting**: Uses RuboCop to lint changed Ruby files.
- **Code Smells**: Uses Reek to detect code smells.
- **Complexity**: Uses Flog to measure complexity.
- **Churn Evaluation**: Evaluates the churn of the changed files to identify frequently modified files.

### Python

- **Linting**: Uses Flake8 to lint changed Python files.
- [Add other Python-specific checks here]

## Churn Evaluation

Churn evaluation provides insight into how frequently files are being changed, which could indicate areas of instability or frequent adjustments in the codebase. High churn files may benefit from further refactoring or architectural changes.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding hooks for other languages or improving existing ones. Please ensure that you update this README with appropriate documentation when adding new hooks.
